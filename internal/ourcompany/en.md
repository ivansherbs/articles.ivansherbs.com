# Vision & Mission

Our vision is to build a health based community using naturally available resources as alternatives and complements to pharmaceutical medicine. Our mission is to provide evidence-based, effective, and simple herbal recipes for your specific health concerns. 

We value health and nature, both for our own company and for our customers. Our sustainable practices focus on climate neutral packaging and the reduction of our carbon footprint. That’s why we hand harvest plants that were grown in the wild and deliver using climate-neutral shipping services.

We endorse the anti-plastic and anti-pollution movements. That’s why we are moving to packaging materials that will either last virtually forever (metal) or naturally degrade completely (plant-based).

With a clear vision, mission and company values in mind, our philosophy focuses on the specific needs of every progressive health-oriented customer, while creating a deep understanding of the development and success factors in the areas in which we operate. 

As industries continuously disrupt the norms, our customers can rely on us to educate them about natural medicines that can be used with or instead of pharmaceutical drugs. Our advice to the pharmaceutical industry is to keep on discovering. We certainly will too.

Life’s journey is fully of choices. At Ivan's Herbs we wish to fully embark on this journey with you. We strive to be your trusted partner that provides you with the best choice of herbal empowerment for every day of your life.

# Founder's Story

Our founder Michael Koch first discovered the health benefits of herbal infusions in 2017 while living in Moscow. It started with Ivan Chai, an herbal infusion hand-made by the common people in Russia since the 17th century, thus earning the common Russian name ‘Ivan’. It was massively exported to Europe before being forgotten after the political turmoil of the 1917 Russian Revolution.

Michael was convinced of its health benefits and ventured to make Ivan Chai with his own hands in a remote Siberian eco-village. He spent one year with the eco-village’s chief herb and tea technologist, learning first-hand about the healing properties of local herbs. When he was in the top health condition of his life, he decided to climb Belukha, Siberia’s tallest mountain.

In the expedition group, by pure serendipity, Michael met a Siberian herbalist named Ivan who had studied traditional herbal medicine for over 20 years. Ivan was the oldest in the group (68) and made revitalising herbal teas from local plants that he scavenged along their trek. After most of the group had achieved the physically demanding 4500 meter summit, Michael returned to Amsterdam to tell this story. Only then did we also start believing in herbs. 

Today, Ivan continues to be one of our advisors on herbs to prevent sickness and remedy health issues.
