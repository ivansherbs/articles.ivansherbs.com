### 2. Ivan’s Herbs Platform
a) Ivan’s Herbs Platform. The Ivan’s Herbs platform enables consumers to purchase a range of herbal products that address health issues. Ivan’s Herbs itself is not a licensed healthcare institution.

b) Membership Options. There are a number of ways to participate in Ivan’s Herbs, such as various subscription plans, promotional plans, and non-subscription purchases. These options consist of different products, services and features and may be subject to additional and differing conditions, prices, policies and limitations. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered options and plans at any time in our discretion. From time to time we may permit non-subscribers to access certain products, services, content or features for a cost or at no cost. Ivan’s Herbs makes no commitment on the quantity, availability, type or frequency at which such products, services, content and features will be available to non-subscribers and may modify, discontinue, remove or suspend access at any time and for any reason in our sole discretion.

c) Subscription Plans. To enjoy full access to the Site and Products, you need to sign up for a subscription. A subscription starts on the date that you sign up for a subscription and submit payment via a valid Payment Method (defined below) or reactivate a pre-existing subscription. Unless we otherwise communicate a different time period to you at the time of sign up or otherwise (such as a multi-month commitment plan), each billing cycle is 4 weeks (28 days) in length (a “Subscription Cycle”). Your Ivan’s Herbs subscription automatically renews every 4 weeks, and we will automatically bill the subscription fee (prices in the EU will include all applicable taxes and non-optional charges) to your Payment Method every 4 weeks, until your subscription is cancelled or terminated. For example, if you purchase your Ivan’s Herbs subscription on April 1, your subscription will automatically renew on April 29 (as further explained in “Subscription Cycles,” below). You must provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment (“Payment Method”). We may update the accepted methods from time to time. If you add a subscription to your base subscription or if you upgrade or downgrade to a different subscription, all such subscriptions will be governed by these Terms and will continue indefinitely until canceled or terminated.

d) Use of Credits. Depending on the subscription plan you choose and purchase, you will be allotted credits to be used solely to purchase Products. You can choose how you use your credits across the various Products available to you. Credits never expire. If your subscription is canceled or terminated your credits can still be used to purchase Products. When your cycle automatically renews, you’ll automatically receive your new allotment of credits. If you have any questions about how to use your credits, please contact us and we can help you.
Credits have no cash value or any other value outside of the Ivan’s Herbs platform and are not redeemable for cash.

e) g) Non-Subscription Purchases. Ivan’s Herb’s may permit you to purchase certain products or Products through the Site, in addition to your subscription or without having a subscription. You acknowledge and agree that these Terms apply to any such purchase you make, and you will be responsible to pay the applicable fees, which may change at any time.

f) Use of Ivan’s Herbs. Your Ivan’s Herbs account is personal to you and you agree not to create more than one account. You must not use or exploit the Site and/or Products for commercial purposes. To use your Ivan’s Herbs membership you must have access to the Internet. We continually update and test various aspects of the Ivan’s Herbs platform. We reserve the right to, and by using the Site and/or Products you agree that we may, include you in or exclude you from these tests without notice. You understand and agree that Ivan’s Herbs may take actions we deem reasonably necessary to prevent fraud and abuse.
 
You agree that the information you provide to Ivan’s Herbs at sign up and at all other times will be true, accurate, current, and complete and that you will keep this information accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you sign up, you will be asked to create a password. You are solely responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, including any activity by unauthorised users. To use the Site you must have access to the Internet. You are solely responsible for providing your own access (e.g., computer, mobile device, Internet connection, etc.) to the Site and Products.

g) Eligibility Criteria. The availability of all or part of our Site and/or Products may be limited based on demographic, age, or other criteria as we may establish from time to time. You understand and agree that we may disallow you from subscribing to Ivan’s Herbs or may terminate your subscription at any time based on these criteria. For example, you must be 16 years of age or older to use this Site and/or Product and/or to purchase a Ivan’s Herbs subscription. You further understand that the Site and/or Products may not be available in every geography. Those who choose to access the Site do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with all local rules including, without limitation, rules about the internet, date, email or other electronic messages, or privacy.

h) Subscribing Organizations. If you are using or opening an account on behalf of a company, entity, or organization (a “Subscribing Organization”), then you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of that Subscribing Organization with the authority to bind such organization to these Terms; and agree to be bound by these Terms on behalf of such Subscribing Organization.

### 3. Fees, Billing, Cancellation

a) Recurring Billing. By initiating your Ivan’s Herbs subscription, you authorize us to charge you for your initial subscription period and a recurring subscription fee at the then current rate. Increases in the current rate will be notified to you by e-mail or other notice (such as when you log into your account). You acknowledge that the amount billed each 4 weeks may vary for reasons that may include differing amounts due to promotional offers and/or changing or adding a plan, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts, which may be billed every 4 weeks in one or more charges. You also authorize us to charge you any other fees you may incur in connection with your use of the Site, such as any applicable cancellation fee, as further explained below. Note that even if you do not use your subscription or access the Site and/or purchase Product, you will be responsible for subscription fees until you cancel your subscription, or it is otherwise terminated.

b) Subscription Cycle. When you sign up and purchase your Ivan’s Herbs membership, your first Subscription Cycle will be billed immediately. Unless we expressly communicated otherwise, your subscription will automatically renew every 4 weeks. Payment will be taken on the effective date of your auto-renew (a “Renewal Date”), provided that, if we are unable for any reason to take payment on a Renewal Date, we will take payment as soon as practically possible thereafter.

c) Refunds. Our subscription fees are nonrefundable, unless we specifically communicate otherwise at the time of purchase. 

We will give a credit refund in full for certain Product where a guarantee is stated and the Product did not work, in view of the subscriber, in a satisfactory way.

d) Price Changes. We reserve the right to adjust pricing at any time. Unless we expressly communicated otherwise, any price changes to your subscription will take effect on your next billing cycle upon notice communicated through a posting on the Ivan’s Herbs website or such other means as we may deem appropriate from time to time, such as email. If you do not cancel your subscription, you will be deemed to have accepted these new fees.

e) Payment Methods. You may edit your Payment Method information by logging onto our website and editing it in your account settings. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds or otherwise, you nonetheless will remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method or any other payment method you have provided, as it may be updated, including in the event you attempt to create a new account, reactivate the unsettled account or sign up for a new account. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. If we cannot charge your account, we reserve the right, but are not obligated, to terminate your access to our Site or any portion thereof.

f) Cancellation. Unless we communicate otherwise, you may terminate your subscription at any time before your subscription renews, by going into your account settings on the Ivan’s Herbs website and letting us know you would like to cancel. Unless we communicate otherwise, following any cancellation you will continue to have access to all Products.
