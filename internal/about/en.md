# The Ivan's Herbs Story

Our founder Michael Koch first discovered the health benefits of herbal infusionsIn 2017 while living in Moscow. It started with Ivan Chai, an infusion by the hand-made by common people in Russia since the 17th century Russia, thus the earning common name ‘Ivan’. It was massively exported to Europe before being forgotten after the political turmoil of the 1917 Russian Revolution. 

Michael was convinced of its health benefits and ventured to make Ivan Chai with his own hands in a remote Siberian eco-village. He spent one month with the eco-village’s chief herb and tea technologist, learning first-hand about the healing properties of local herbs. When he was in the top health condition of his life, he decided to climb Belukha, Siberia’s tallest mountain.

In the expedition group, by pure serendipity, Michael met a Siberian herbalist named Ivan who had studied traditional herbal medicine for over 20 years. Ivan was the oldest in the group (68) and made revitalising herbal teas from local plants he scavenged along their trek. After most of the group had achieved the physically demanding 4500 meter summit and Michael returned to Europe to tell this story, did we also start believing in herbs.

Today, Ivan continues to be one of our advisors on herbs to prevent sickness and remedy health issues.
