## Proven effectiveness of fireweed to support Prostate health

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved fireweed for “relief of lower urinary tract symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia” in their final assessment of *Epilobium angustifolium* (Anonymous, 2018).

Additionally, the EMA claimed that ‘due to the widespread traditional medicinal use for more than 30 years the safety of *Epilobium angustifolium*… can be assumed' (Anonymous, 2018).

To date (2019) there have been no clinical level studies to confirm that taking doses of fireweed reduces the PSA levels of males. However, there have been three studies done on human prostate cancer cells that showed evidence that fireweed infusions can significantly reduce the level of PSA secretion (Denq, 2019,Stolarczyk, 2013a,Stolarczyk, 2013b).

## Cultural History of fireweed as Ivan Chai

In the 16th century, Russian monks were forbidden to drink coffee or tea because caffeine was believed by the Russian federal government to cause "intoxication". The monks, seeking alternative beverages, harvested herbs from wild fields and produced their own herbal infusions. The monks noticed that fireweed produced a fragrant floral infusion that had a noticeable effect on their mental state and overall health. The herbal infusion soon became immensely popular with Russians and Europeans alike.

The term "Ivan Chai" was given to the herbal infusion by the foreigners who still enjoyed it in England and other European countries.
