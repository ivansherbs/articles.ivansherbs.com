# The Ivan's Herbs Story

In 2017 our founder Michael lived in Moscow, Russia with too much stress and in poor health when he discovered the reviving health properties of drinking Ivan Chai. It’s a healthy herbal infusion that was easily accessible and hand-made by the common people in the 17th century Russia, thus the earning common name ‘Ivan’. It was massively exported to Europe before being forgotten after the political turmoil of the Russian Revolution of 1917. 

It’s history and health benefits convinced our founder to make Ivan Chai with his own hands in a remote Siberian eco-village. After spending one month with the eco-village’s herb and tea chief technologist, our founder felt that he was ready to attempt to climb to Siberia’s tallest mountain -- Belukha.

In his expedition group he met a Siberian herbalist named Ivan who had studied traditional herbal medicine for over 20 years. Ivan was 68 years old but in excellent health, making revitalising herbal teas for the group from local plants as they successfully reached the physically demanding 4500 meter summit. Today, Ivan is our advisor on Siberian herbal tea blends to prevent sickness and remedy chronic diseases. 

Our mission is to provide effective, and simple to understand herbal recipes to address your specific health issues.
