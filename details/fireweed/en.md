It's best to **avoid mixing** medication and herbs within **3 hours of each other**, as many combinations have not been tried or tested. To date (2019), no known interactions or side effects of fireweed have been reported ([WebMD]).

If you're on any medication, stay on it unless otherwise prescribed by your doctor.

**Pregnancy and breastfeeding** Not enough is known about the use of fireweed during pregnancy and breast-feeding. It is recommended to avoid use.

## Proven effectiveness of fireweed

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved fireweed for “relief of lower urinary tract symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia” in their final assessment of *Epilobium angustifolium* ([Anonymous, 2018]).

Additionally, the EMA claimed that ‘due to the widespread traditional medicinal use for more than 30 years the safety of *Epilobium angustifolium*… can be assumed' ([Anonymous, 2018]).

To date (2019) there have been no clinical level studies to confirm that taking doses of fireweed reduces the PSA levels of males. However, there have been three studies done on human prostate cancer cells that showed evidence that fireweed infusions can significantly reduce the level of PSA secretion ([Denq, 2019],[Stolarczyk, 2013a],[Stolarczyk, 2013b]).

## Cultural History of Fireweed as Ivan Chai

In the 16th century, Russian monks were forbidden to drink coffee or tea because caffeine was believed by the Russian federal government to cause "intoxication". The monks, seeking alternative beverages, harvested herbs from wild fields and produced their own herbal infusions. The monks noticed that fireweed produced a fragrant floral infusion that had a noticeable effect on their mental state and overall health. The herbal infusion soon became immensely popular with Russians and Europeans alike.

The term "Ivan Chai" was given to the herbal infusion by the foreigners who still enjoyed it in England and other European countries. Its popularity in England grew so drastically that by the end of the 19th century it was most likely noticed as a small threat to the Dutch East India Company. Rumours were supposedly spread that the Russians were poisoning Ivan Chai with white clay.

In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917, commercial production ceased and the consumption of Ivan Chai had practically fell to zero for Russia and the rest of Europe. Even in Russia, this beneficial herbal infusion remains somewhat unknown, and is slowly making a revival.
