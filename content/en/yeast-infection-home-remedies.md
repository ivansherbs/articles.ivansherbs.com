  - **Practise good personal hygiene**
    Make sure you wipe from front to back after visiting the bathroom to prevent bacteria from the anus travelling to the vagina.
  - **Avoid tight-fitting jeans and pants**
    Stay cool, dry and airy in loose-fitting pants and jeans.
  - **Keep yourself dry and clean**
    Wipe yourself dry after a bath or shower. Change out of your sweaty clothes or wet swimsuit as soon as you can. Yeast loves to grow in damp places.
  - **Avoid perfumed deodorant sprays, scented tampons and vaginal douches**
    These may affect the delicate balance of yeast and bacteria in the vagina and cause yeast infections.
  - **Relax and reduce stress**
    Some studies show a link between chronic stress and vaginal yeast infections. Stress lowers your body’s immune system. Exercise, meditation and getting enough sleep can relieve stress.

## What is a Yeast Infection?

A yeast infection (also called candidiasis) is fungal infection on different body parts.

The [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/yeast-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20378999), a trusted academic medical center, defines a vaginal yeast infection as:

> ...a fungal infection that causes irritation, discharge and intense itchiness of the vagina and the vulva — the tissues at the vaginal opening.

The technical term is vaginal candidiasis, named after the fungus (*Candida albicans*) which is the culprit of this type of infection.

Put another way, we define it as a *Candida albicans* overgrowth.

Let's see some fast home remedies that you can do to cure it.


## Yeast Infections Home Remedies

Let's look at 4 ways of how to cure yeast infections at home fast. 


**Drink Ivan Chai (fireweed tea)**

One way to cure any type of yeast infection is with fireweed tea. In Russia the traditional tea of the rolled fireweed leaves is called Ivan Chai.

Where's the evidence for this? 

According to a study published on the website of the [National Institute of Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5045895/), more than 5 separate scientific studies have shown the anti-fungal effects of fireweed.

To be a bit scientific, it's the antioxidants Quercetin and Oenothein B found in fireweed which have a medicinal effect on fungal, yeastm and bacterial infections.

There's even more to this remedy. In their plant of the week post, the [U.S. Forest Service](https://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/plant-of-the-week/chamerion_angustifolium.shtml#:~:text=High%20in%20vitamins%20A%20and,addition%20to%20the%20home%20garden.) has stated that fireweed is high in Vitamin C. 

Why does that even matter?

It matters a lot because [Vitamin C](anchorlink) is in itself is a remedy for yeast infections. I'll go further into that home remedy later.

If you'd like to our try our Ivan Chai hand-made from 100% fireweed leaves, [you're welcome to get a trial here](https://www.trial.ivansherbs.com/yeast-infections).

To cure yeast infections at home, drink two cups of Ivan Chai daily.


**Apply Coconut Oil**

Coconut oil is just the fatty oil that comes from coconuts. Among it's other benefits, coconut oil is known to be an anti-fungal.

This [one study from 2016](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scientifica/2016/7061587/) has shown that it is comparably as effective as other pharmaceutical drug solutions (Chlorhexidine and Ketoconazole).

To cure a vaginal yeast infection, you need to apply it. This could be done by applying the oil to a clean tampon and inserting the tampon.

It's recommended that you use pure coconut oil, and prefeably organic. You can tell its 100% coconut oil because it won't have a strong coconut smell to it.


**Use Wild Oregano**

What is needed here is not your typical oregano you find on your pizza. That's common oregano (*Origanum marjoram*).

Essential oil of Oregano is made from wild Oregano (*Origanum vulgare*) and contains Thymol and Carvacrol. These are your trusted anti-fungals for this home remedy.

Where's the proof? This study from the [Journal of Applied Microbiology](https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jam.13413) showed how essential oil of Oregano negatively changed the growth of our culprit *C. albicans*.

To apply this home remedy, put 3-5 drops of essential oil per ounce of olive oil. Then rub the mixed oils on your skin, not your vaginal area.

I repeat, *do not apply to vaginal area*, as that cause irritation. By applying it to your skin (arms, legs, whatever), the anti-fungals are absorbed into your body.

Another method is to use the essential oil in aromatherapy. Simply put a few drops in your infuser and inhale.

Another word of caution for those will bleeding disorders. Wild oregano is a blood thinner, so don't use it at all if you have blood-clotting issues or are already taking blood thinners.


**Take Vitamin C**

Vitamin C boosts your immune system. Fact.

A strengthened immune system is better able to fight a yeast infection.

What else, right?

Well taking Vitamin C helps regulate your blood sugar. Still wondering what's the point?

*Candida albicans* just loves sugar. Reduce your sugar levels, and you'll reduce Candida.

But wait, there's more. 

The technical name for Vitamin C is ascorbic acid. When you take it, it raises your stomach acid.

High acid levels in your stomach slows down Candida. Candida just hates acid.

To use Vitamin C as a home remedy, take up 3000 mg per day. Your body can't absorb more than that.

Useful tip: take 1000 mg of Bioflavanoids for every 2000 mg of Vitamin C. It boosts the effectiveness and prolongs the effect.
