## Proven safety and effectiveness of menstrual cramps recipe

Chamomile and mefenamic acid was tested in 80 women over 6 period cycles in a placebo-controlled triple blind study. The results clearly showed that after 2 cycles of treatment, chamomile was effective at reducing the intensity of pain associated with dysmenorrhea. This trial study showed chamomile to be more effective than mefenamic acid in treating dysmenorrhea with statistical significance ([Modarres, 2011]).

Lemon balm was tested in 100 women over 4 period cycles in a placebo-controlled double-blind **clinical trial**. The results clearly showed that after 2 cycles of treatment, lemon balm was effective at reducing the intensity of pain associated with dysmenorrhea ([Mirabi, 2017]).

To date (2019) no controlled trials have been done with calendula to measure its effectiveness against dysmenorrhea. However, just like chamomile and lemon balm, there is a long history of traditional use of calendula to treat menstrual pain and cramps ([Arora, 2013]; [Ashwlayan, 2018]).
