## Proven safety and effectiveness of menstrual cramps recipe

Chamomile and mefenamic acid was extensively tested in 80 students over 6 period cycles in a placebo-controlled triple blind study. The results clearly showed that after 2 cycles of treatment, chamomile was effective at reducing the severity of menstrual pain. Chamomile was shown to be more effective than mefenamic acid ([Modarres, 2011])

Two separate double blind studies with lemon balm were conducted each with over 90 women, and both studies confirmed that lemon balm reduced the perceived pain during menstruation ([Mirabi, 2018]; [Mirabi, 2019])

To date (2019) no clinical level study of the effects on dysmenorrhea have been done with calendula. However, just like chamomile and lemon balm, there is a long traditional use of calendula to treat menstrual cramps and pain. [ref Arora, ref Medcrave] 

To date (2019) no clinical level study on the effects of menstrual pain have been done with red clover. However, a study of 72 women indicated that red clover reduced the symptoms of menopause [ref Shakferi]. Red clover contains phytoestrogens as isoflavones, which can have effects like estrogen in the body. Thus, it has not been proved safe for children and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
