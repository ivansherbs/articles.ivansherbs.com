## Preparation

To prepare a meadowsweet infusion, steep **2 g** (1 teaspoon) of meadowsweet flowers in **1 cup** (250 mL) of boiling water (**100°C**) for **10-15 minutes** and then strain.

A meadowsweet infusion can be taken anytime for pure enjoyment of its floral notes with a sweet aftertaste.

## Dosage and course of treatment

For acute, serious, and immediately present symptoms of the health issues described above, drink **1 cup** during waking hours **every 1-2 hours**. As symptoms subside, gradually space out the dose to **1-2 cups daily**.

For a chronic health issue drink **1 cup** before meals **3 times daily**.

When using meadowsweet to treat or prevent a health issue, or relieve the symptoms, take the appropriate dose for **at least 8 days**. If your health issues has been remedied, you can stop taking doses on a regular basis.

If a regular basis is needed, drink **1 cup** before meals **3 times daily** for **8 days**. Let the body acclimate and **stop taking doses for 3 days** before starting another **8 day treatment**. Meadowsweet can be taken in this 8-days-on-3-days-off cycle continuously.

## Precautions

It's always advised to consult your health professional and do your own research before starting any treatment to avoid interactions.

It's best to **avoid mixing** medication and herbs within **3 hours of each other**, as many combinations have not been tried or tested. Meadowsweet is known to interact with aspirin, as both have similar effects.

If you're on any medication, stay on it unless otherwise prescribed by your doctor.

Use smaller doses for children under 12, due to salicylate content. Meadowsweet should be avoided by those with a sensitivity to aspirin or salicylates.

Avoid meadowsweet during pregnancy, as it may stimulate uterine activity.

## Contraindications and warnings

Salicylate constituents have been documented and therefore the usual precautions recommended for salicylates are relevant for meadowsweet ([??? Willow](Willow)). Meadowsweet is stated to be used for the treatment of diarrhoea in children, but in view of the salicylate constituents, this is not advisable. Bronchospastic activity has been documented in preclinical studies and, therefore, it is prudent to advise that meadowsweet should be used with caution by asthmatics. Aqueous extracts have been reported to contain high tannin concentrations and excessive consumption should therefore be avoided.

## Pregnancy and lactation

In vitro utero-activity has beendocumented for meadowsweet. In view of the salicylate constituents and the lack of toxicity data, the use of meadowsweet during pregnancy and lactation should be avoided.

## Proven safety and effectiveness of meadowsweet

Meadowsweet flowers, like many natural products, contain pro-drugs. Pro-drugs are substances which must undergo a biotransformation inside the body (in vivo) to become an active medical drug.

Meadowsweet flowers naturally contain a group of compounds called salicylates. The primary ingredient in aspirin (acetyl-salicylic acid) is a salicylate and a pro-drug. Aspirin becomes the active compound salicylic acid inside the body.

A standard dose of aspirin contains approximately 325 mg of acetylsalicylic acid (99% pure) and is taken every 4-6 hours for general pain relief, inflammation, and swelling ([J&J C. Inc., n.d.]). A dose of 2 g of meadowsweet flowers prepared in an infusion has less than 3 mg of methyl salicylate, the primary salicylate naturally present [ref Ollenikov].

Clearly, just the 3 mg of methyl salicylate present in a 2 g dose of meadowsweet flowers would give a lower level of pain relief than a dose of 325mg concentrated pharmaceutical strength aspirin.

However, 2 g of meadowsweet flowers contains about 270 mg of 119 different compounds ([ref Olennikov]; [Bijttebier, 2016]). The major active compounds are salicylates, tannins, and phenolic compounds. The mixture of these compounds creates an overall effect that is safer than aspirin as will be explained below.

Firstly, it has been confirmed that that the tannins and phenolic compounds found in meadowsweet are partially responsible for the anti-ulcer, anti-fever (antipyretic), and anti-inflammatory properties ([Samardžića, 2018]).

Aspirin, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ([J&J C. Inc., n.d.]), have been proven to provoke ulcers. [ref Cryer]  The probability of a person dying from a stomach (peptic) ulcer is low today, at 1 in 100,000. For a duodenal ulcer, the probability is much higher at 5 in 100 [ref what is the mortality rate].

An infusion from meadowsweet protects the body from ulcers forming in the first place (anti-ulcerogenic) [ref A Clinical Guide to, ref Braun, Lesley]. In an in vivo study done on rats, ulcers were induced using high doses of aspirin. Rats that were given meadowsweet infusions before the high dose of aspirin did not form ulcers. Furthermore, rats that already had stomach ulcers experienced higher healing when given meadowsweet infusions as treatment ([Barnaulov, 1980]).

The anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving (analgesic) actions of meadowsweet flowers have been well studied and confirmed ([Bone, 2003]; [Bone, 2007]; [ref Hoffmann, Lewis]).

## Cultural history of meadowsweet

In Russian folklore the heroic knight Kudryash became terrified at the prospect of his own death and refused to fight. In shame, Kudryash planned to drown himself, a fair maiden emerged from the water giving him a garland of meadowsweet flowers, then told him that "no harm would befall of him if he wore it in battle". Kudryash remained unscathed and undefeated.

Fresh meadowsweet is placed on the altar for love spells, or dried is used in various love mixtures. It is also strewn about the house to keep peace and the scent of Meadowsweet is said to cheer the heart. If gathered on midsummer, Meadowsweet will give you information regarding thieves: if you have been robbed, place Meadowsweet on water. If it sinks, the thief is a man. If it floats, a woman.

Meadowsweet is used for love, peace and happiness. The fresh plant is used as an altar decoration or in a bridal bouquet. The scent of meadow sweet is said to cheer the heart.
