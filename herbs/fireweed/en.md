How you ask? Ivan’s Herbs provides 100% wild grown herbal tea from organic origins with proven benefits on health issues.

Our Ivan Chai herbal recipe contains a natural herb which was proven to reduce symptoms related to an enlarged prostate (also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH).

The fermented leaves of fireweed give you compounds that help slow the growth of your prostate and keep inflammation in check.
