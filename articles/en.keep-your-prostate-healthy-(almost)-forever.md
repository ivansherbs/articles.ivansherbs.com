# Have a healthy prostate (almost) forever

Taking preventative care of your health is the best thing you can do — that would have saved my father’s early death (only 53) from a simple lung infection. That’s why today I write about a male body part most fail to take care of before there are problems: the prostate.
According to Movember, prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer for men in Europe. But don’t lose hope for the prostate just yet. Instead, inform yourself (or a male friend you care for) about what you can do.
If you want reliable information on prostate health but don’t know where to begin, this post is going to be your best resource. Read it thoroughly to get all the information you need to assess your next best step.
Some of the prostate health issues, symptoms, and remedies you may already know, but I’ll going to show you every solution that I could find. I’ll back it up with the medical and scientific references out there so you can choose the best way to keep (or heal) your prostate health.
Specifically, you’ll learn about the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, remedies (and their side effects) for each of the following prostate health issues:
1. Enlarged prostate (also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH)
2. Inflamed prostate (also known as prostatitis)
3. Prostate Cancer
For those that know enough about their condition, and wish to explore how to remedy it both naturally and with prescription drugs, feel free to jump to the following sections:
1. How to remedy an enlarged prostate
2. How to remedy prostatitis
3. How to remedy prostate cancer
Before we dive right in, let’s learn a bit about more about the prostate.
About the prostate
The male prostate has the important function of transporting sperm out of the body during male ejaculation. The prostate fluid mixes with the sperm cells, which have been pumped to the prostate gland during ejaculation, to create semen. The slightly alkaline prostate fluid comprises about 30% of the volume of semen. 
So where is the prostate? It’s in the lower abdomen, immediately under the bladder and around the urethra. This gland is about the size of a walnut and is part of the male reproductive system.
Here’s what a normal prostate looks like:

Enlarged Prostate
What is an enlarged prostate?
A natural process occurs as men age: new prostate tissue grows and the prostate enlarges. It’s a completely benign growth of the prostate that will never turn into cancer. It’s common for men over 50 and not a serious threat to your health. It’s also commonly referred to as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), benign prostate enlargement (BPE), or simply enlarged prostate gland.
Why does an enlarged prostate occur?
The cause of enlarged prostate is unknown to scientists. The most important factors seems to be “age, testosterone, various growth factors, and a failure of cell death.” [harvard site ref]
What are the symptoms of an enlarged prostate?
As the prostate becomes larger, it blocks the flow of urine. About half of men experience symptoms by age 60. Symptoms include:
	•	the need to urinate more frequently/urgently
	•	frequent urination during the night
	•	weak urine flow
	•	difficulty starting to urinate
	•	accidentally leaking urine (urinary incontinence)
	•	feeling of bladder fullness
	•	some dribbling of urine

The above can be collectively called lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).
More serious symptoms can occur, and include the following:
	•	inability to urinate (a serious medical condition)
	•	a burning sensation during urination
	•	kidney damage
	•	bladder stones
	•	blood in the urine
	•	more frequent bladder infections

How is an enlarged prostate diagnosed?
They are many ways to diagnose an enlarged prostate. Here are the most common methods.
	•	Questionnaire: This is a simple set of questions to document the symptoms and severity of each. It’s a common starting point.
	•	Digital rectal exam (DRE): A physician inserts a lubricated and gloved finger into the rectum to feel the back side of the prostate.
	•	Urine test: Analysis of urine can help determine if there is infection or other condition that would cause the same symptoms.
	•	Blood test: This is to determine if there is a an issue with the kidneys.
	•	Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test: A high PSA result (above 4 ng/mL) in the blood can be (but not always) an indicator of prostate cancer.

Additional tests may be done to confirm an enlarged prostate, depending on the complexity, and to rule out other conditions:
	•	inability to urinate (a serious medical condition)
	•	Transrectal ultrasound: An ultrasound probe is inserted into the rectum, which emits high energy sound waves to produce a live image of the prostate.
	•	Post-void residual volume test: This test measures how much urine is left in your bladder after urination. It can be done by ultrasound or with a catheter.
	•	Urine flow study: This a test where you voluntarily empty your bladder and the volumetric flow is measured (i.e. mL / unit time). It’s used to see how the bladder is working.
	•	Urodynamic and pressure flow studies: A catheter is inserted in the urethra into the bladder. Air or water is slowly injected into the bladder. It’s used to see how the bladder is working. This test is usually for men with neurological problems or with a previous prostate procedure.
	•	Cytoscopy: Flexible tube with a small camera is inserted into the urethra. The doctor can then examine the inside of the bladder and urethra.
	•	Prostate biopsy: A transrectal ultrasound guides needles used to take tissue samples of the prostate. This test can help diagnose or rule out prostate cancer.

Let’s compare how an enlarged prostate may look in comparison to a normal one:

Notice how the enlarged prostate pushes against the bladder.

Remedies for an Enlarged Prostate
The first question one may ask is: Can you prevent an enlarged prostate?
The short and best answer is no. The main factors, age and family history, are out of your control. What you can do is lower your risk, manage symptoms, and keep your prostate healthy as it slowly grows.
Here are the natural methods, with scientific evidence to back it up.
Pumpkin seeds 
- Benefits: Pumpkin seeds have long been claimed to help manage the symptoms of an enlarged prostate. It has been used in Egyptian and Eastern Europe as a folk remedy.
- Research: The oils in pumpkin seed seem to be interrupting ‘the triggering of prostate cell multiplication by testosterone and DHT [ref].’ In 2006 this was positively confirmed in a Egyptian study on rats, and thus may alleviate symptoms of an enlarged prostate. (ref)
- Side Effects: Eating pumpkin seeds in high amounts, since they have a high amount of fibre, may cause bloating or gas. Too much at once may cause constipation.

Saw palmetto 
- Saw palmetto has been shown to both help prostate health (ref 1) or shown to do nothing (ref 2). With this evidence present, it make sense to try saw palmetto to see how it works for you. Be sure to take the doses consistently and for the required amount of time. Side effects and interactions are mild and similar to those experienced when taking a sugar pill (ref). Saw palmetto should not be taken by women who are pregnant or on birth control, as it acts as a hormone.

- Getting more of your protein from plant and fish sources, compared to other meat based protein, has been shown over an eight year study to reduce the risk of enlarged prostate. (Ref) (ref review). In short, less protein is better. Stay away from the animal protein when you can.
- Lycopene supplements have beed proven to slow the progression of an enlarged prostate. The study was conducted over six months. (ref)


Zinc
