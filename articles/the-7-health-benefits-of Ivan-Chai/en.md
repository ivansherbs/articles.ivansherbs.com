# The 7 health benefits of Ivan Chai

Ivan’s Herbs mission is to provide fact-based, effective and simple herbal recipes for your specific health problems. Informing and teaching the benefits of Ivan Chai is based on contemporary scientific articles and feels like second nature to us.

Below is a brief overview of the benefits of Ivan Chai, after which we briefly discuss it and provide you with insights based on contemporary statistics. The 7 health benefits of Ivan Chai are as follows:

1) Immunity
2) Powerful anti-inflammatory
3) Improves sleep and reduces stress and anxiety
4) Anti-oxidant and enhances anti-tumor activity
5) Provides prostate and urinary tract health
6) Cares for the digestive system
7) A slightly sweet taste by nature

We would like to emphasize that health problems can be complex, painful and frightening. The human body is an intelligent system capable of self-regulation and healing, whereby help from outside may be embraced. Below the statistics and scientific substantiation of the health benefits.

# Immunity
## Anti-Infections

Fungi are present in everyone (including oral or vaginal). An excess amount of fungi, or Candida, can be increased by using pharmaceutical drugs (eg Antibiotics, Anti-Conception Pill and Stomach Acid Inhibitors) ([13], [13.0]).
Approximately 1,600,000 women use the contraceptive pill ([13-1]). In addition, around 2,000,000 people regularly use a stomach acid inhibitor ([13-2]). Antibiotics take the lead, this pharmaceutical drug is sold around 4,000,000 times for oral use alone ([13-3]).
Risk factors that increase the chance of an excess amount of yeast, bacteria and fungi are smoking, dentures and diabetes ([13-4]).

Ivan Chai strengthens immunity:
- The antimicrobial properties of Ivan Chai have been well studied, showing that it prevents yeast, bacteria and fungi ([2], [1]). Because of these anti-fungal properties, it helps prevent the growth of Candida (yeast) in the digestive system. A healthy digestive system means better absorption of nutrients, which leads to a stronger immune system.

# Powerful anti-inflammatory
## Bladder infection

In women over 12 years, cystitis is common. Approximately 20% of women experience this annually ([14], [14-1], [14-2]). Sex is the biggest risk factor for getting a bladder infection. Recent research has shown that 57% of patients with recurrent cystitis reported that their relationship was adversely affected ([14-3.0], [14-3.1]).

## Intestinal infection

More than 55,000 people suffer from a chronically inflamed intestinal wall ([14-3.2]). In the medical world, this form of inflammation is also known as 'Enteritis' ([14-3]). The most common inflammations are viral or bacterial, radiation-induced, medication-induced, alcohol or drug-related intestinal infections, or are a result of poor circulation ([14-3.3]) due to, for example, sitting still for too long.

## Weak immune system due to Pharmaceutical Medications or Chemotherapy

With a shortage of white blood cells, the immune system weakens ([14-4]). Pharmaceutical drugs and chemotherapy have the side effect of killing white blood cells. These white blood cells play an important role in the immune system ([14-5], [14-6]). Of the 800,000 people who survived cancer, the majority still experience the consequences in daily life ([14-7]).

## Blurred mind due to Pharmaceutical Medications or Drugs
When taking pharmaceutical drugs or drugs, such as Cocaine, XTC, Cannabis, Speed, Mushrooms, Truffles and LSD, side effects can occur with a blurred mind ([14-8]). The correct doses of active substances in pharmaceutical medication that can be evenly transported to the brain have not yet been optimally discovered. It is quite a challenge for doctors to find the right amount for heavy pharmaceutical medicines ([14-9]).

In addition, the after-effects of various types of drugs result in dizziness, blurred vision, nausea and anxiety ([14-10]). The number of drug users is difficult to identify. Depending on the definition we provide, there are an estimated between 1,000,000 and 17,000,000 drug users. XTC or MDMA are prohibited by law. Approximately 1,000,000 Dutch people have used XTC or MDMA. Every month there are 100,000 people in the Netherlands at the XTC or MDMA. 20% of the Dutch population (2,800,000 million people) have ever smoked a joint. Around 100,000 people sniff cocaine every month ([14-11]). Drug use is especially popular with highly educated people ([14-12], [14-13], [14-14]). The side effects of pharmaceutical drugs and drugs cause a blurred mind.

Ivan Chai works as a powerful anti-inflammatory:
- Ivan Chai is a powerful anti-inflammatory ([9], [7], [1], [4]). It has been proven to be more effective than Cortisol in suppressing inflammation ([6]). Reducing inflammation is an effective way to remedy many health problems, such as your bladder, intestines, a weak immune system or a blurred mind.

# Improves sleep and reduces stress and anxiety
## Sleep
According to the CBS, more than 20% of Dutch people aged 12 or older say they have problems sleeping ([15-1]). According to the same source, people with a work disability most often have sleeping problems. Sleep problems hinder people in their functioning and increase the risk of poorer health ([15-2]).

## Stress & Burnout complaints
According to the major Dutch health insurance companies, between 17% and 23% of working people suffer from burnout complaints. In addition, 53% of employees experience stress at work. This amounts to € 2,300,000,000, saying: two billion and three hundred million euros per year in absence costs due to work stress ([15-3], [15-3.1]).

## Fear
In 2018, more than 450,000 people were treated by a general practitioner for an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are more common in women than in men.
In addition, women feel more vulnerable and experience more fear without makeup ([15-4]).

Ivan Chai improves sleep and reduces stress and anxiety:
- Ivan Chai is decaffeinated. It helps you to sleep and to overcome sleep disorders. In addition, it is a well-known mild tranquilizer in traditional folk medicine ([10], [9]). Scientists do not know the exact reason how it helps with sleep disorders ([4], [9]). Ivan Chai has a calming effect that works well against stress and helps to reduce anxiety.

# Antioxidant and anti-tumor activity
## Alzheimer's disease - Vitamin E deficiency
In approximately 60 to 70% of cases, Alzheimer's disease is the degenerative disease of dementia. This can be caused by a vitamin E deficiency. Over 90 years, 40% have dementia. At a younger age dementia starts between 40 and 65 years. In the Netherlands we have around 12,000 people younger than 65 who have been diagnosed with dementia ([16-1], [16-2]).

## Cardiovascular diseases - Vitamin E deficiency
-Netherlands has approximately 1,400,000 cardiovascular patients.
<br> <br> -1 in 4 women in the Netherlands dies of cardiovascular disease.
<br> <br> -In the Netherlands there are an estimated 670,000 women with cardiovascular diseases.
<br> <br> -Every day almost 300 women are admitted to hospital due to cardiovascular disease ([16-1], [16-3]).

## Prostate cancer
Prostate cancer is diagnosed in more than 12,000 Dutch men every year.
Men from the age of 50 are more likely to contract prostate cancer. ([16-4])

Ivan Chai works as an antioxidant and strengthens anti-tumor activity:
- Ivan Chai is packed with polyphenols, which act as the most important group of components that are responsible for the action of antioxidants ([8], [5]). According to scientific research, the responsible compound "Oenothein B", another polyphenol, was found to have anti-tumor activity ([8], [3]). The anti-tumor effect is a well-studied specific effect aimed at healthy prostate cells ([8]).

# Provides prostate and urinary tract health
## Prostate infection
30% of men over the age of 50 have problems with urinating ([17-1]).

## BPH (Prostatic hyperplasia)
30% of men from the age of 50 suffer from an enlarged prostate gland ([17-2]).

## Urinary tract infection
80% of women get urinary tract infection at least once in their lives ([17-3]).

Ivan Chai takes care of prostate and urinary tract health:
- The renowned European herbalist M. Trebens used it quite specifically for the prostate during her treatments according to her herbal recipe with Ivan Chai ([10]). It has been found effective after thousands of reviews of men and women to remedy the swelling and inflammation of the prostate gland (prostatitis). In addition, it also helps prevent prostate growth (BPH, prostatic hyperplasia). The responsible compound (Oenothein B) has been identified as the chemical compounds found in plants (Polyphenol), which is responsible for the positive effect of Ivan Chai on the prostate ([8]). Herbalist M. Trebens also recommended Ivan Chai for urinary tract infections, cystitis, kidney and bladder problems. Ivan Chai is not only good for men in terms of urogenital. Women also benefit (10).

# Cares for the digestive system
## Digestive Imbalances
1 in 4 people in the Netherlands sometimes has stomach problems. No apparent causes were found for these stomach complaints, and yet we suffer from the stomach wall or heartburn. These complaints are known as functional stomach complaints ([18.1]).
In addition, on average 30 to 40 percent of tourists to (sub) tropical areas from the Netherlands suffer from traveler diarrhea ([18.2]).

Ivan Chai takes care of the digestive system:
- Ivan Chai takes care of your digestive system. Ulcers, Gastritis and Colitis can all be remedied by drinking Ivan Chai ([6], [4]). It helps prevent inflammation of the stomach wall and the smaller and larger intestine. It serves to stabilize digestive imbalances for people with irritable bowel syndrome or who are undergoing dietary changes. Intestinal parasites can even be eliminated by drinking a decoction with large amounts of Ivan Chai ([6]).

# Naturally slightly sweet taste - no sugar required
## Diabetes
On average, Dutch people consume 30% more sugars per day. With children even 80%. This amounts to around 25 kilos of free sugars per year. This can lead to being overweight. In addition, there are other consequences due to sugar intake - roughly 20 ([19]).

Ivan Chai naturally has a slightly sweet taste:
- Ivan Chai has been tasted by various tea experts. The taste is described as follows: Ivan Chai has a very soft taste that is comparable to traditional black tea, but with a naturally slightly sweet taste ([11], [12]). Children love this taste. This makes adding sugar unnecessary.
