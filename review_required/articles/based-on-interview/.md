_Wereldwijd neemt het gebruik van natuurlijke geneesmiddelen, als aanvulling of alternatief op farmaceutische medicijnen, toe. Het gebruik van kruiden als medicijn heeft voornamelijk als doel om ziekten te bestrijden. Uit onderzoek met een focus-groep van 46 personen met een gemiddelde leeftijd van 52 jaar, waarvan de meerderheid bestond uit vrouwen, is gebleken dat voornamelijk voor de ouderen het voorkomen van ziekten en het verbeteren van de gezondheid van belang waren. Hiernaast worden kruiden gebruikt als natuurlijke oplossing voor een behandeling met conventionele medicijnen, waarbij de focus-groep de limieten van kruiden erkent om ernstige ziekten te bestrijden._

Ontevredenheid over een behandeling met farmaceutische medicijnen, goede ervaringen en verhalen over het gebruik van kruiden evenals familietraditie waren redenen om kruiden te gebruiken bij een behandeling.   



Between a drug that is made from a plant, or one which is synthetic, I would always decide for the herbal one, simply because one always knows where one stands. If one reads the package of different medicines, I know only very few of the ingredients. (..) I personally would still always prefer to try this (HM) first before taking any other remedy which I do not exactly know what it is. I would just trust more that it could help. Maybe it is also a placebo effect, but I prefer to take this into account rather than putting something into my body when I really do not know what it is and that it is chemically-made.

We found that treating illnesses was the most frequently discussed aim for using herbal medicine over all age groups. Preventing illnesses and promoting health were less frequently mentioned overall, but were important for elderly people. 

Discussions on herbal medicine were associated with either mild/moderate diseases or using herbal medicine as a starting treatment before applying conventional medicine. In this context, participants emphasized the limits of herbal medicine for severe illnesses. 

Dissatisfaction with conventional treatment, past good experiences, positive aspects associated with herbal medicine, as well as family traditions were the most commonly-mentioned reasons why herbal medicine was preferred as treatment. Concerning information sources, independent reading and family traditions were found to be equally or even more important than consulting medicinal experts.

Although herbal medicine is used mostly for treating mild to moderate illnesses and participants were aware of its limits, the combination of self-medication, non-expert consultation and missing risk awareness of herbal medicine is potentially harmful. This is particularly relevant for elderly users as, even though they appeared to be more aware of health-related issues, they generally use more medicine compared to younger ones. In light of our finding that dissatisfaction with conventional medicine was the most important reason for a preferred use of herbal medicine, government bodies, doctors, and pharmaceutical companies need to be aware of this problem and should aim to establish a certain level of awareness among users concerning this issue.



An Interview with herbalist Karen Effenberger

Herbs are plants with leaves, seeds or flowers used for flavoring, food, medicine or perfume. An herbalist is a person who practices healing with the use of herbs.

Taking supplements as well as changing my diet made a big difference in how I felt. As an adult, I was referred to an herbalist to continue to improve my health. At the time, I did not know much about herbs. Herbs have vitamins, minerals and enzymes in them, so for medicinal reasons, it is easier for the body to utilize and absorb the herb rather than just a single mineral or vitamin. My health improved and I started studying with several master herbalists. Initially, this study was for my benefit and interest, but it soon led to helping others heal with the use of herbs.

Herbs have been used by all cultures for 1,000’s of years. Herbs are listed in the bible for their healing properties. I believe herbs can be used to improve all body systems including digestion, elimination, immune, nervous, muscular/structural, respiratory and circulatory systems. Herbs are food and when you give the body the food it needs, it can heal itself.

The World Health Organization estimates that 80% of the world’s population or 4 billion people use herbal medicines for some of their health care. Thirty percent of the US population uses herbal remedies each year. In the past 10 years, the use of herbal supplements has grown over 380%.

We know many pharmaceuticals trace their origins to herbal remedies. What would you say to someone who doubts their effectiveness? 

Karen – Herbs work and are most effective if you are taking the correct one for your body and the correct dosage. There are numerous herbs that can help each physical condition. If you try one and it doesn’t work, then try another. Remember that herbs are dried and put in a capsule and you will probably need more than one capsule for most conditions. Herbs do not have the same potency as medicines. Muscle testing is a method of testing that I use to determine the correct herb for the individual and the correct dosage. I have found it to be very accurate. Over the years, many of my clients have told me they notice a difference as soon as they take the herbs I recommend. Many of these same clients were taking other supplements without seeing any differences in their health. Taking the right herb does make a difference.
