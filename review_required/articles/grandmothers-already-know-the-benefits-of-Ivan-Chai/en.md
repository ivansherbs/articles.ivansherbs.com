# Grandmothers already know the benefits of Ivan Chai

Anecdotal evidence is powerful. And attentive grandmothers have heard many many anecdotes. 

They’re data mines for home nutrition and wellness, among other topics. A bonus is that they don’t (generally) speak in complicated terms. They’re understandable. 

Grandmothers from the former USSR know about fireweed. Fireweed, also commonly known as rosebay willowherb, was collected in the USSR and elsewhere for its many health benefits. 

The leaves of the fireweed plant can be fermented and made into a traditional herbal infusion, today still called by its historical name, Ivan Chai.

Ask grandma what are the health benefits of Ivan Chai are and you’ll get simple answers. 


## Anti-inflammatory
It has been well studied in academia to determine that fireweed is a powerful anti-inflammatory ([Serebryanaya, 2016], [Sayik, 2018], [Battinelli, 2001], [Kolesova, 2017]). It has been proven to be more effective than cortisone in suppressing inflammation ([Rogers, 2014]). Reducing inflammation is an effective way to remedy many health issues such as your gut, a weak immune system, or a foggy mind. If grandma was very attentive, she may have noticed.


## Digestive System
Grandmothers will tell you that Ivan Chai heals your digestive system. Ulcers, gastritis, and colitis can all be remedied by drinking Ivan Chai ([Rogers, 2014], [Kolesova, 2017]). It helps prevent inflammation of the stomach lining, as well as the smaller and larger intestine. It serves to stabilise digestive imbalances for those with irritable bowel syndrome or undergoing changes in their diet. The Woodlands Cree grandmothers had learned that intestinal parasites could be eliminated by drinking a decoction made from the entire fireweed plant ([Rogers, 2014]). Your grandma would say it just soothed your tummy.


## Sleep, Excitability, and Anxiety
Ivan Chai is caffeine free. It helps you get to sleep and overcome sleep disorders. It’s a known mild sedative in folk medicine ([Wood, 2010], [Serebryanaya, 2016]). Neither scientists nor grandmothers know exactly how it aids in sleep disorders ([Kolesova, 2017],[Serebryanaya, 2017]). If grandma had insomnia though, she would certainly know how to remedy it.

Ivan Chai calms you down. That’s probably why Russians I’ve spoken with have told me that they drank it when they were kids (again, my small collection of anecdotes). Grandmas also knew that it was naturally sweet, so it wouldn’t take much convincing for children to drink it. 


## Immunity
It’s antimicrobial properties have been well studied, showing that the compounds in fireweed inhibit yeasts, bacteria, and fungi over a broad spectrum of species ([Borchardt, 2009],[Battinelli, 2001]). Due to its antifungal properties, it helps against candida (yeast) overgrowth in the digestive system. Every one can reason the following: a healthy digestive system means better absorption of nutrients, which leads to a strengthened immune system.


## Urogenital
Your grandma may never have said the word “urogential”, but she knew a thing or two about prostate health. Renowned European herbalist Maria Trebens had used fireweed quite specifically for the prostate ([Wood, 2010]). It was found effective, after thousands of anecdotal reports from men and their wives, for remedying prostatitis (swelling and inflammation of the prostate gland) and growth of the prostate growth (scientifically known as BPH, benign prostatic hyperplasia). The compound responsible, oenothein B, has been identified as the polyphenol responsible for fireweed’s effect on the prostate ([Schepetkin, 2016]). Wise old grandmother Trebens further recommended fireweed for urinary tract infections, cystitis, kidney, and bladder problems — and not just for men ([Wood, 2010]). 

So that’s how grandma kept grandpa healthy.


## Antioxidant and Antitumor activity
Grandma might have never said the words “tumor” and “antioxidant”. Even less so, the word “polyphenol”. 

Fireweed is packed with polyphenols, which acts as the main group of constituents responsible for the antioxidant activity ([Schepetkin, 2016],[Ostrovska, 2017]). The compound oenothein B, another polyphenol, has been found to have antitumor activity ([Schepetkin, 2016], [Miyamoto, 1993]). It’s antitumor effect has been well studied specifically for prostate cells ([Schepetkin, 2016]).


May grandmothers’ natural health wisdom live on.
