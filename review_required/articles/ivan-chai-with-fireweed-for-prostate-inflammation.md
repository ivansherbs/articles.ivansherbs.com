# Ivan Chai as an Effective Treatment for an Inflamed Prostate

The herb fireweed, prepared as a fermented herbal tea historically known as Ivan Chai, has long been known as an effective treatment for an inflamed prostate, i.e. prostatitis.

## Proven Effectiveness and Evidence for Prostatitis

Ivan Chai is made from the fermented leaves of fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium).

Other species of *Epilobium* were used to treat prostatitis in Europe after Austrian herbalist Maria Trebens published her success in using *Epilobium* herbal tea treatment in the 1970s and 1980s (Anonymous). The flavonoids present in fireweed are beneficial for inflammation processes such as prostatitis and benign prostate hyperplasia (Rogers). Modern research has begun to identify the compounds in fireweed that make fireweed a medicinal treatment for disorders such as prostatitis (Adamczak).

## Dosage and course of treatment

Drink **1 cup** before meals **2 times daily** for **at least 10 days**.

For a **chronic** health issue drink **1 cup** before meals **3 times daily**.

If your prostatitis has been remedied, you can stop taking fireweed on a regular basis. Restart treatment if symptoms reappear.

This therapeutic dose is continually referenced in the Europeans Medicines Agency’s final assessment of fireweed (EMA).

## Safety, contraindications and warnings

Fireweed is an extremely safe herbal infusion. It can be taken as a herbal infusion in excessive amounts and is **safe for children**.

It’s naturally **free of caffeine**, uric acid, oxalic acid, and L-theanine.

It's always advised to consult your health professional and do your own research before starting any treatment to avoid interactions.

The EMA has claimed that ‘due to the widespread traditional **medicinal use for more than 30 years** the safety of *Epilobium angustifolium*… can be assumed' (EMA).

## Cultural History of Fireweed as Ivan Chai

In the 16th century, Russian monks were forbidden to drink coffee or tea because caffeine was believed by the Russian federal government to cause "intoxication". The monks, seeking alternative beverages, harvested herbs from wild fields and produced their own herbal infusions. The monks noticed that fireweed produced a fragrant floral infusion that had a **noticeable effect on their mental state and overall health**. The herbal infusion soon became immensely popular with Russians and Europeans alike.

The term "**Ivan Chai**" was given to the herbal infusion by the foreigners who still enjoyed it in England and other European countries. Its popularity in England grew so drastically that by the end of the 19th century it was most likely noticed as a small threat to the Dutch East India Company. Rumours were supposedly spread that the Russians were poisoning Ivan Chai with white clay.

In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917, commercial production ceased and the consumption of Ivan Chai had practically fell to zero for Russia and the rest of Europe. Even in Russia, this **beneficial herbal infusion** remains somewhat unknown and **is slowly making a revival**.
