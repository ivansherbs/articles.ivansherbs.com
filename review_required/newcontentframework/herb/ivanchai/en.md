### Enlarged prostate

The European Medicine's agency has approved infusions of Ivan Chai 'for the relief of lower urinary tract symptoms related to.." an enlarged prostate. [https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/final-assessment-report-epilobium-angustifolium-l/epilobium-parviflorum-schreb-herba_en.pdf]

### Prevention of prostate cancer

Many studies have investigated and confirmed that fireweed has an antitumor activity.

Further clinical trials are necessary to prove with certainty if fireweed can prevent prostate cancer.

### Sedative and Anxiety Relief (collapsible -opening triggers Audience capture event)
A few studies with rodents have shown specific anxiety relieving properties [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18284819)[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20171069)[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12062586)[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1891490)[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22529473). 

### Antidepressant (collapsible -opening triggers Audience capture event)

A study on mice shown that the ani-depressant effect was similar to that of the reference drug imipramine [6](http://daru.tums.ac.ir/index.php/daru/article/view/520).

### Antiviral (collapsible -opening triggers Audience capture event)

An infusion of lemon balm, as well as the isolated compounds, showed strong anti-viral activity against herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). The complete lemon balm infusion showed the strongest effect at lower doeses than any of the isolated compounds, indicating a synergistic effect [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22377592).

### Antibacterial and antifungal (collapsible -opening triggers Audience capture event)

Lemon balm exhibited activity against bacteria, types of fungi, and yeasts[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7630324). It was demonstrated to have strong antibacterial activity again *Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus aureus* and *Baceillus cereus* [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18361749).

An infusions of lemon balm inhibited the growth of *Candida albicans*, which is the most common cause of a yeast infection. However, green tea, cassia, and lemon grass infusion showed even greater antifungal activity [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20185867).

### Anti-inflammatory (collapsible -opening triggers Audience capture event)

Two compounds naturally found in lemon balm have evidence for anti-inflammatory activity. Rosmarinic acid [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3198307)[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1761351) and eugenol [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12444669)[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10782484) both reduce inflammatory processes.

### Cholinergic (collapsible -opening triggers Audience capture event)

Lemon balm appears to increase the activity in the cholinergic system in the brain; this is necessary for memory and attention.

Studies done indicate that lemon balm may have a role to play in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy due to its activity on central nervous system receptors [12](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/%28SICI%291099-1166%28199612%2911%3A12%3C1063%3A%3AAID-GPS532%3E3.0.CO%3B2-1)[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10687867)[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15652288)[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18284819)[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22510493)[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18810999)[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19070498). Although one trial study indicated that a certain enzyme was not inhibited, the same trial showed improved cognitive function and mood and concluded that lemon balm was a valuable adjunct to Alzheimer's therapy [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12888775).
