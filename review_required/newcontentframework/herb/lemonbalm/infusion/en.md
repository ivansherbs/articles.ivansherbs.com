## Anxiety
### Evidence level: Strong

A small, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, crossover trial involving 18 healthy volunteers investigated the effects of lemon balm extract in two different doses. A significant reduction in stress in was seen in the volunteers taking the larger dose; however alertness was also reduced at the higher dose. ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15272110])

A prospective, open-label, 15-day pilot study evaluated the effectiveness of a standardised lemon balm extract on 20 participants with mild anxiety disorders. 95% of the participants responded to the treatment. 70% achieved full remission for anxiety, 85% for insomnia, and 70% (14/20) for both.([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3230760/])

The German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices approves the use of lemon balm in the treatment of anxiety and restlessness. ([http://cms.herbalgram.org/expandedE/LemonBalm.html])
