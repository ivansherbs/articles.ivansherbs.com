Lemon balm infusions have traditionally been used to improve mood and cognitive function, but the potential benefits don’t stop there. Read on to learn more about this plant’s possible healing powers.

## Alzheimer's disease

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed the effectiveness and safety of lemon balm in 42 patients with moderate Alzheimers over 16 weeks. By week 4, the difference between the placebo and lemon balm was statistically significant. By week 16, the difference was highly significant. By week 8, the difference was significant on the clinical dementia rating scale and also highly signficant by week 16 ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12810768]).

## Anxiety

A small, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, crossover trial involving 18 healthy volunteers investigated the effects of lemon balm extract in two different doses. A significant reduction in stress in was seen in the volunteers taking the larger dose; however alertness was also reduced at the higher dose. ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15272110])

A prospective, open-label, 15-day pilot study evaluated the effectiveness of a standardised lemon balm extract on 20 participants with mild anxiety disorders. 95% of the participants responded to the treatment. 70% achieved full remission for anxiety, 85% for insomnia, and 70% (14/20) for both.([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3230760/])

The German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices approves the use of lemon balm in the treatment of anxiety and restlessness. ([http://cms.herbalgram.org/expandedE/LemonBalm.html])
